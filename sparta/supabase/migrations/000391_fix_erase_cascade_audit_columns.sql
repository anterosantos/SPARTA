-- Migration: 000391_fix_erase_cascade_audit_columns
-- Purpose: Fix fn_erase_subject_cascade (000185) — it inserted into audit_logs
--          using columns "metadata" and "created_at", which don't exist on
--          that table (audit_logs has "payload" and "occurred_at", per 000080).
--          This made every call to erase-cascade fail with
--          'column "metadata" of relation "audit_logs" does not exist',
--          silently breaking the GDPR right-to-erasure flow since it was written.
